# chsch: don't add the model folder to src folder, as this will lead
#  to the removal of that folder while putting its content to the plugin root.
#  This in turn results in different path's to annotations.ecore depending on
#  having it as source or installed in the platform.
# UPDATE: Xtext is now able to resolve ecore-based meta models (here the annotations.ecore)
#  by means of namespace URIs if and only if metamodel is contained in a source folder that
#  is additionally mentioned in the source.. declaration of the build.properties and the
#  Xtext nature is added to the project containing the meta model.
#  For this reason that nature is attached to this bundle and 'model' is added to 'source..'.
