\chapter{Used technologies}
\label{chapter:ConfTechnology}
- before explaining solutions
- short explanation about the technology in question
- small sketch to get an idea of the context
- full explanation goes beyond the scope of this work
\section{Eclipse}
- KIELER part of Eclipse framework
- Jave IDE but also lots of other languages (C++, Latex, ...)
- can build other IDEs with it
- citation: IDE an for anything, and nothing in particular \cite{eclipseOverview}
\subsection{Plugins}
- KIEM itself is a plugin, this work plugin dependant on \abbrev{KIEM}
- different components of an IDE 
- can operate by themselves or depending on other plugins
- in addition to API of each plugin: extension point mechanism
- extension points to interact with other plugins
- extension point mechanism used by runtime environment to check which plugins to load
- plugins can be used to plug into the standart Eclipse feature
\subsection{Preference Pages}
- One of the plugins used in this work in that fashion is the org.eclipse.ui.preferencePage
plugin. It is used to create new preference pages at a specific location inside the
normal tree of preference pages accessable through Window>Preferences.
The programmer only has to take care of the contents of the actual page and not worry
about addional buttons or integrating it into the PreferenceDialog.

\subsubsection{Preference Store}
- Closely coupled with the preference pages is the eclipse preference store. It is
basically a text file for each plug-in where the plug-in can deposit simple Strings
under a given key to ensure that information is kept between execution runs.
