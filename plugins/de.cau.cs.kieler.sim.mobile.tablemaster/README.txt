This plug-in represents the DataComponent on the KIELER Execution Managers
site, that provides a TCP server for connection from the J2ME mobile table
client that is implemented by the de.cau.cs.kieler.sim.mobile.table
application.
In order to make the server accessible from outside, you will need to ensure
the according port is open in your firewall and router settings.
