# KIELER Semantics

*Semantics* is part of the overarching [KIELER project](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/kieler/) and represents research on the semantics of modeling languages, especially synchronous languages, in combination with pragmatics-aware modeling techniques.
The focus is on Sequentially Constructive Charts (SCCharts), a successor of SyncCharts that is also synchronous state chart dialect but with sequentially constructive semantics.
See the [SCCharts wiki pages](https://github.com/kieler/semantics/wiki) for further information and detailed documentation.

The KIELER SCCharts tool provides a modeling environment for SCCharts, including specialized automatically generated graphical views, model-transformation-based compilation, and simulation.
