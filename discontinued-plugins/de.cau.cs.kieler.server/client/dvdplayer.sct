// The DVD PLAYER is an example that uses signals, concurrency, and preemption.
// The model is first in state Off. If the signal POWER is present then it tran-
// sitions to the On state. If, in the On state, the POWER signal is present again
// then the model will transition to state Off again, preempting any internal
// behavior of the On state.
// In the On state the tray can be opened (initially) or closed. The user can
// toggle between states OpenedTray and ClosedTray using the EJECT input signal.
// The ClosedTray state has two concurrent threads. The first allows to toggle
// between states Pause, Play, and Stop using the PLAY and the STOP input signals.
// The other thread allows to toggle between three languages using the
// AUDIO input signal.
//
// The example was adapted from the following publication:
// Hauke Fuhrmann. On the Pragmatics of Graphical Modeling. Dissertation, Kiel 
// University, Faculty of Engineering, Kiel, 2011.
