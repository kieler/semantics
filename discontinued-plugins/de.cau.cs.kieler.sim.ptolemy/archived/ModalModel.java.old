//// ModalModel

/**
 This is a typed composite actor designed to be a modal model.
 Inside the modal model is a finite-state machine controller, and
 inside each state in the FSM is a refinement model. To use this
 actor, just drag it into a model, and look inside to start constructing
 the controller.  You may add ports to get inputs and outputs, and
 add states to the controller.  You may add one or more refinements
 to a state (each of these refinements will be executed when this
 actor is executed).  Each refinement is required to have its own
 director, so you will need to choose a director.
 <p>
 The controller is a finite-state machine (FSM), which consists of
 states and transitions.  One of the states is an initial state.
 When this actor executes, if the current state has a refinement,
 then that refinement is executed.  Then the guards on all the outgoing
 transitions of the current state are evaluated, and if one of those
 guards is true, then the transition is taken.  Taking the transition
 means that the actions associated with the transition are executed
 (which can result in producing outputs), and the new current state is
 the state at the destination of the transition.  It is an error if
 more than one of the guards evaluates to true.
 <p>
 To add a state, click on a state button in the toolbar, or drag
 in a state from the library at the left.  To add a transition,
 position the mouse over the source state, hold the control button,
 and drag to the destination state.  The destination state may be
 the same state, in which case the transition is used simply to
 execute its actions.
 <p>
 Adding or removing ports in this actor results in the same ports appearing
 or disappearing in the FSM controller and in each of the refinements.
 Similarly, adding or removing ports in the controller or in the
 refinements results in this actor and the other refinements
 reflecting the same change to the ports.  That is, this actor,
 the controller, and the refinments all contain the same ports.
 <p>
 There is one subtlety regarding ports however.  If you add an
 output port to a refinement, then the corresponding port in the
 controller will be both an input and an output.  The reason for
 this is that the controller can access the results of executing
 a refinement in order to choose a transition.
 <p>
 This class is designed to work closely with ModalController and
 Refinement, since changes to ports can be initiated in this class
 or in those. It works with continuous-time as well as discrete-time
 models.
 <p>
 By default, this actor has a conservative causality interface,
 which examines the FSMActor controller and all the refinements
 and defines input/output dependencies that are the oPlus combination
 of all their dependencies. If
 the <i>stateDependentCausality</i> is false (the default),
 then this causality interface in conservative and valid in all
 states. If it is true, then the causality interface will show
 different input/output dependencies depending on the state.
 In each state, only the controller and the current refinement
 will be considered, and in the controller, only the outgoing
 transitions from the current state will be considered.
 <p>
 This class also fulfills the CTEventGenerator interface so that
 it can report events generated inside.
